# Change Log

## [0.3.0] - (pending)

 * `regex` has been switched to `onig` so we have full compatibility with all the other grok patterns.
 * Added `Grok::with_patterns()` which loads all the default patterns. `Grok::defalt()` also uses that now.
 * `iter()` is available on `Matches` which yields a `(&str, &str)` kv pair of match/result.

## [0.2.0] - 2017-09-06

 * Instead of panicing, all methods that could return a `Result<T, grok::Error>`.
 * `Grok::new()` has been renamed to `Grok::empty()` (or `Grok::default()`)
 * `is_empty()` is available in the `Matches` API to check if there are matches at all.
 * `len()` is available in the `Matches` API to get the total number of matches.

## 0.1.0 - 2017-09-05

 * Initial Release
